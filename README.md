## 1. User Experience (UX)

### 1.1 Project introduction
This website is a concept model for a website aimed at helping parents traveling with their children. The site features a variety of activities to do with kids whilst traveling. <br><br>
This demo concept contains prepopulated experiences added for Florence & Copenhagen, whilst a fully fletched version of the site would incorporate functionality to allow users to add additional experiences to the database.<br>
It provides search functionality to find experiences based on city and category filtering, enabling users to quickly navigate to relevant content.

Users can search for experiences and write their own review of the experiences, with build-in functionality to edit and delete previously posted reviews.

### 1.2 Design approach
The site was build using an agile methodology. The method applied was a Kanban Board. Here's an image of the Kanban board earlier in the process.
